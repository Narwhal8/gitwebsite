            <h1>FAQ: <br></h1>
            <h3 class="headerBox">What is this game?<br></h3>
            Welcome to Mercantium, a long-term passion project by me. It is my first major solidity project and I wanted
            to
            make an on-chain game where EVERYTHING was on-chain, not just some of the mechanics. <br><br>
            Currently, I would describe the game as a combination of an Economic Simulator & City Management game, with
            additional unique gameplay elements that require long-term, strategic thinking if you want to be the best
            city
            in the realm.<br>
            <h3 class="headerBox">What are the features?<br></h3>
            Great Question! The current feature list includes:
            <ul>
                <li>The ability to pick from one of 9 Kingdom Types, and add some of the over 30 Land types to your
                    demesne
                </li>
                <li>Develop your kingdom with upgradeable housing & industry to produce some of the hundreds of goods in
                    the
                    world</li>
                <li>Employ your population to grow some of the dozens of different crops on your land, extract what is
                    naturally on it for unique resources, or invite your nobility to hunt it for lucrative game</li>
                <li>Engage in trade with the world in an ever-evolving economy to secure the resources you can't make or
                    don't want to make, or focus your kingdom on filling its demands for massive profits</li>
                <li>Optimize productivity with proper nutrition, gifts, medical care and more, or run a spartan kingdom
                    with
                    none of the headaches of optimization</li>
                <li>Build up an army of soldiers you personally equip in a highly customizable system, or hire
                    mercenaries
                    to engage in PvE quests for exclusive rewards</li>
                <li>With more to come as development progresses!</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="headerBox">Wen Launch?</h3>
            &emsp; &emsp;If you are reading this, the freeplay test version is probably live. A full, premium mainnet
            launch
            may or may not happen subject to time and economic constraints.<br><br>
            <h3 class="headerBox">Is the test build different then the main planned build?<br></h3>
            &emsp; &emsp;As of now, the main differences are overall less features and a ~300x decrease in time
            requirements
            for all in-game actions.
            <h3 class="headerBox">How can I give you money? <br></h3>
            &emsp; &emsp; This is a fairly common question I receive. For the time being I am not looking for
            individuals to
            fund this project. The primary reason behind this is that full development including audits would be fairly
            expensive, and I do not want to only partially fund the project or take money without having at least a very
            high likelihood of completion. If you represent a foundation or some other organization looking to fund
            games
            then feel free to reach out and I will be more then happy to discuss what we can provide to you in exchange
            for
            funding.<br><br>
            <h3 class="headerBox">Will Progress be Reset? <br></h3>
            &emsp; &emsp;As a test version, it is highly likely that the game will be reset at various points in time. I
            will attempt to ensure players get resources to rebuild but no promises.<br><br>
            <h3 class="headerBox">Is this website safe?<br></h3>
            &emsp; &emsp;Probably. I realize this isn't reassuring but as this is my first website and I realize people
            can
            have a lot on hot wallets so I would rather be transparent. This website uses only a single library
            (ethers.js)
            and is otherwise coded by me.
            There is very little chance ethers.js gets compromised and my code only interacts with the blockchain in
            basic
            well-defined ways. There are also no approvals of any tokens required to play as of now.
            If this is not enough to make you feel comfortable connecting I would highly recommend using a new wallet
            with
            no funds in it to reduce potential losses to zero.
            <h3 class="headerBox">Is the smart contract safe?<br></h3>
            &emsp; &emsp;This is another probably. Although I have tested the contract to a degree, due to both the
            novelty
            of this game and relative lack of experience with programming I cannot guarantee such.
            This is why the game is currently on testnet, is free to play, and does not rely on approving tokens of any
            sort
            to minimize any potential harm to users. Again if the lack of certainty bothers you and you are still
            interested
            in trying the project, it is best to use a wallet with no valuable tokens in it.
            <h3 class="headerBox">How do I get started?</h3>
            <text> &emsp; &emsp; Great question! The first step is to pick a kingdom type (Go to select action -> Set
                Kingdom Type) and acquire the respective type of land (If you are playing on the testnet build of this
                game,
                Simply go to the land shop and claim your initial free land and pick a kingdom based on what you
                receive).
                If you have any questions about which land does what you can either consult the game encyclopedia or
                simply
                ask.</text>
            <br>
            <br>
            <text> &emsp; &emsp;Second, it is recommended that you build some housing (Go to select action -> Build ->
                Land
                Permit) so you have people to develop the land. This process will use 20 land of your choosing from your
                wallet per house</text>
            <br>
            <br>
            <text> &emsp; &emsp;Third is add some of your land directly to your kingdom (Go to select action -> Add Land
                To
                Kingdom) This land will now be workable. It is best to reserve some land as other buildings such as
                Cookeries that can be built later need a few land and can't use land already added to the kingdom for
                this
                purpose</text>
            <br>
            <br>
            <text> &emsp; &emsp;Fourth, you can finally get to resource production now! (Go to select action -> Work
                Land).
                You can either farm crops by clicking on one, or get "Natural Resources" from the land such as wood and
                stone to build your kingdom. You can also use food to increase the yields from your land by adding it in
                the
                box labeled "What would you like to feed your workers". This step is however optional and when you start
                out
                you will not have any additional food</text>

                Winter: Temperature -20
                <br>
                Spring: No change
                <br>
                Summer: Temperature + 20
                <br>
                Fall: Temperature - 10
