        <h1>FAQ: <br></h1>
        <h3>What is this game?<br></h3>          
        This (as of yet unnamed game) Is simply a passion project by me. It is my first major solidity project and I wanted to make an on-chain game where EVERYTHING was on-chain, not just some of the mechanics. <br><br>
        <h3>What are the features?<br></h3>
        Great Question! The current feature list includes:
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to pick from one of 9 Kingdom Types, and add some of the over 30 Land types to your demense</li>
            <li>Develope your kingdom with upgradeable housing & industry to produce some of hundreds of goods to either increase your productivity or sell to the market for what you lack</li>
            <li>Employ your population to grow some of the dozens of different crops on your land, extract what is naturally on it for unique reasources, or invite your Nobility to hunt it for lucractive game</li>
            <li>Build an army up of soliders you personally equip in a highly customizable system, or hire mercenaries (merc hiring/prices still under development) to engage in PvE quests for exclusive rewards</li>
            <li>With more to come as development progesses!</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Wen Launch?</h3>
        &emsp; &emsp;If you are reading this, the freeplay test version is probably live. A full, premium mainnet launch may or may not happen subject to time and economic constraints.<br><br>
         <h3>Is the test build different then the main planned build?<br></h3>
         &emsp; &emsp;As of now, the main differences are overall less features and a ~300x decrease in time requirements for all in-game actions.
        <h3>Will Progess be Reset? <br></h3>
        &emsp; &emsp;As a test version, it is highly likely that the game will be reset at various points in time. I will attempt to ensure players get reasources to rebuild but no promises.<br><br>
        <h3>Is this website safe?<br></h3>
        &emsp; &emsp;Probably. I realize this isn't reassuring but as this is my first website and I realize people can have alot on hot wallets so I would rather be transparent. This website uses only a single library (ethers.js) and is otherwise coded by me.
        There is very little chance ethers.js gets compromised and my code only interacts with the blockchain in basic well-defined ways. There are also no approvals of any tokens required to play as of now.
        If this is not enough to make you feel comfortable connecting I would highly recomend using a new wallet with no funds in it to reduce potential losses to zero.
        <h3>Is the smart contract safe?<br></h3>
        &emsp; &emsp;This is another probably. Although I have tested the contract to a degree, due to both the novelty of this game and relative lack of experience with programing I cannot guarntee such. 
        This is why the game is currently on testnet, is free to play, and does not rely on approving tokens of any sort to minimize any potential harm to users. Again if the lack of certainty bothers you and you are still intrested in trying the project, it is best to use a wallet with no valueble tokens in it.
        <h3>How do I get started?</h3>
        <text> &emsp; &emsp; Great question! The first step is to pick a kingdom type (Go to select action -> Set Kingdom Type) and aquire the respective type of land (If you are playing on the testnet build, simply ask for some). If you have any questions about which land does what you can either consult the game encylopedia or simply ask.</text>
        <br>
        <br>
        <text> &emsp; &emsp;Second, it is recomended that you build some housing (Go to select action -> Build -> Land Permit) so you have people to develope the land. This process will use 20 land of your choosing from your wallet per house</text>
        <br>        
        <br>
        <text> &emsp; &emsp;Third is add some of your land directy to your kingdom (Go to select action -> Add Land To Kingdom) This land will now be workable. It is best to reserve some land as other buildings such as Cookeries that can be built later need a few land and cant use land already added to the kingdom for this purpose</text>
        <br>        
        <br>
        <text> &emsp; &emsp;Fourth, you can finally get to reasource production now! (Go to select action -> Work Land). You can either farm crops by clicking on one, or get "Natural Reasources" from the land such as wood and stone to build your kingdom. You can also use food to increase the yields from your land by adding it in the box labeled "What would you like to feed your workers". This step is however optional and when you start out you will not have any additional food</text>
